## About
This repository contains the implementation of the word2vec model (skip-gram architecture) as proposed by Mikolov et al. in the paper *[Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf)* .

## How to run

### Setting the hyperparameters
All the hyperparameters are loaded from `config.json` file. Here I have briefly described the meaning of each of these hyperparameter flags present in `config.json`.
